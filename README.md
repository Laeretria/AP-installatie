# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Philips Hue Go Portable Light White and Color Ambiance
- Philips Hue Bridge
- Raspberry Pi
- Switch
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- 2 Ethernet Cable
- 3 Buttons
- HDMI Cable
- TV screen
# ‚õ∫ Setup
**Step 1** - Setting Up Raspberry Pi

1. Prepare your Raspberry Pi:
- Install Raspberry Pi OS on the microSD card.
- Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi.
- Connect the Raspberry Pi to the TV using the HDMI cable.
- Connect the keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry Pi.

2. Power on the Raspberry Pi:
- Connect the Raspberry Pi to a power source using the USB-C power adapter.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Raspberry Pi setup, including connecting to Wi-Fi.

**Step 2** - Setting Up the Philips Hue Bridge and Lights

1. Connect the Philips Hue Bridge:
- Plug the Philips Hue Bridge into a power outlet.
- Connect the Hue Bridge to your router using one of the Ethernet cables.
- Wait for the lights on the Hue Bridge to turn on and stabilize

2. Set up the Philips Hue Go Light:
- Turn on the Philips Hue Go light.
- Using the Philips Hue app on your smartphone, follow the instructions to connect the Hue Go light to the Hue Bridge.

**Step 3** - Wiring the buttons
1. Prepare the Breadboard and Buttons:
- Place the three buttons on the breadboard.

2. Connect the Buttons to the Raspberry Pi:
- Use jumper wires to connect one terminal of each button to the ground (GND) pin on the Raspberry Pi.
- Connect the other terminal of each button to different GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. Use GPIO20, GPIO18, and GPIO4.

# üå± Install

To install the project, follow these steps:

**Step 1** - Download or clone the project locally

**Step 2** - Run Python script

> **NOTE:**  On a Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspberry Pi OS, Python 3 is typically pre-installed. However, if for some reason it isn't available or if you want to ensure you have the latest version, you can install it manually. Here‚Äôs how you can check if Python 3 is installed and how to install it if necessary: `python3 --version
` or  `sudo apt install python3`


```

  sudo python3 main.py

```
> **NOTE:**  Leave the script running in the background.

**Step 3** - Install `RPi.GPIO`

```

  sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio

```

**Step 4** - Install `keyboard` Library

```

  sudo pip3 install keyboard

```

**Step 5** - Enable GPIO and Set Permissions

```

  sudo adduser $USER gpio

```

**Step 6** - Reboot your Raspberry Pi for the changes to take effect

```

  sudo reboot

```

**Step 7** - Install a webserver of your choice on the Raspberry Pi (in this case Apache 2)

```

  sudo apt-get install apache2 

```

**Step 8** - Copy the project to the webroot directory

```

  sudo mv your-project-folder /var/www/html

```

**Step 9** - Run Apache 2

```

  sudo systemctl start apache2

```

**Step 10** - Automatically start Apache 2 on boot
```

  sudo systemctl enable apache2

```

# üõû Configuration of Philips Hue Bridge

First we need to locate the ip address.

**Step 1** - Install nmap 

```

  sudo apt install nmap

```

> **NOTE:**  Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

**Step 2** - Use `ifconfig` to locate the ip address of your Raspberry Pi

```

  ifconfig

```

**Step 2** - Run nmap

```

  sudo nmap 192.168.0.1-255

```
[![IMG-NMAP.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Nf0STrkw/IMG-NMAP.png)](https://postimg.cc/CdWcp52v)

**Step 3** - Change the endpoint to the ip address of the Philips Hue Bridge in `hue/client.js` folder

```

  let endpoint = "http://192.168.0.55";

```
> **NOTE:**  You're going to have to press the button on the Philips Hue Bridge before use. Afterwards it will run automatically.

> *_**TIPS**_: You can change the devicetype to any name you want. Simply do this by overwriting this line (which is on line 3 of the project in the folder `hue/client.js`): `const device = JSON.stringify({ devicetype: "your-device-name" });`*

# ‚úàÔ∏è Run
After installing all the necessary libraries and completing the configuration of the Philips Hue Bridge, you can now take a look at the project. Follow these steps:

**Step 1** - Surf to `localhost/your-project-folder`
